This is a mod for [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at/) that automatically creates and removes waypoints for projectiles that only you've fired. Other player's projectiles will not be tracked. Most of the code is server-side, so it will only work if the server also has the mod. The main reason for running server-side is so that waypoints can be updated without the player being near them.

For releases, check the [mod page on the Vintage Story mod database](https://mods.vintagestory.at/projectiletracker).
